# DSA-InClass-BSTSearch

Features

	•	Efficient Search: Leverages the BST structure for logarithmic time complexity in average cases.
	•	Dictionary Operations:
	•	Insert: Add new dictionary words and definitions.
	•	Search: Quickly find a word and retrieve its meaning.
	•	Delete: Remove a word from the dictionary while maintaining the BST structure.
	•	Traversal Options:
	•	Inorder traversal for retrieving words in alphabetical order.
	•	Preorder and postorder traversals for alternative use cases.
	•	Error Handling: Handles duplicate entries and invalid deletions gracefully.

 Use Cases

	•	A lightweight dictionary application for fast lookups.
	•	Educational purposes to demonstrate the functionality of BSTs.
	•	Foundation for more complex data structures or algorithms.

 Installation

	1.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/bst-dictionary-search.git cd bst-dictionary-search

 How It Works

	1.	Insertion:
	•	New entries are added based on alphabetical order.
	•	Words smaller than the current node go to the left; larger ones go to the right.
	2.	Search:
	•	Quickly locates a word by traversing the tree based on comparisons.
	3.	Deletion:
	•	Removes entries while preserving BST properties, handling leaf nodes, single-child nodes, and two-child nodes.
